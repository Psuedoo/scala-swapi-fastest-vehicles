# Scala SWAPI Fastest Vehicles

I was given an interview prompt years ago to get the 3 fastest vehicles from [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev).

- interacting with an API
- parsing JSON
- pagination
- error handling

I like solving this problem when working in newer languages to me.

Here is my (sloppy) solution in Scala!
